      <description>Shrey&amp;rsquo;s Masterclass Program This is a 2 weeks (14 days) hands-on course to learn any technical framework with challenge based learning. In each track, every day a set of topics and resources would be given to study, including blogs, articles, tutorials, docs, etc.
Along with the topics, you would also be given a daily challenge/task to complete which would involve practically implementing the day&amp;rsquo;s tasks.
This would enable you to learn by implementation.</description>
